# Hi there 👋

I'm a Chemistry student who happens to be deeply fascinated by computers, the internet, cloud services ☁️, and artificial intelligence 🤖.  
Always learning, always curious. 📚

A passionate gamer 🎮 when I'm not busy exploring the tech universe.

Currently diving deeper into cloud computing, machine learning, and everything in between.  
Feel free to reach out if you share similar interests or just want to chat about cool ideas!
